## Depth First

### Challenge
- Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.

### Approach & Efficiency
- I used class, function, if statements.

### Big O:
**In General:**
depthFirst ==> Time: O(1) becuse it is a recurseve function, Space: O(1) becuse there is no additional memory.
