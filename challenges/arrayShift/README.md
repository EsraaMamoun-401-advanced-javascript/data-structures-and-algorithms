### Sheft Array
> This code is return the array with inserted value in the middle index.

### Challenge
It is a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added (as an argument), then return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

### Approach & Efficiency
- I used a function which return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
- Inside the function I used Math and floor method to get the middle index, and splice method to put the value in the middle.
